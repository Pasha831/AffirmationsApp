# AffirmationsApp
Simple app with a list of affirmations

## What i've learned?

* Deeper knowledge about classes and their inheritance in Kotlin
* How to use `List`s in Kotlin (`MutableList` and `List`)
* Basic knowledge about `RecyclerView` (what is it, what's inside it, how to use it, how to make my own adapter)
* Packets and imports in Kotlin
* What is `MaterialCardView` and how to use it in a connection with `RecyclerView`
* How to test `List`s and `Adapter`s with an aid of `Espresso` and `mockito` libraries (the latter library right now don't want to be friendly with me, i promise that in future i'll understand what's wrong!)
